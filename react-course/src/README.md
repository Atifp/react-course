// each function should start with a capital letter
// All html tags such as button, h1, h2 tetc, they can be seen as React components, where you can add attributes to the tag
// For example, in <button></button>, we can add the 'onClick' attribute
// State allows you to configure what is shown on the screen dynamically
// props (or params) help build reusable components
